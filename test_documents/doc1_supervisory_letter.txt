CONFIDENTIAL SUPERVISORY INFORMATION

Board of Directors
First National Bank of Commerce
San Francisco, CA

Dear Members of the Board:

This letter summarizes supervisory concerns identified during the examination of First National Bank of Commerce
(RSSD 1234567) conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank as of January 30, 2026.
The examination was conducted in accordance with Federal Reserve System policies and procedures and covered the period
from December 16, 2025 through January 30, 2026.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Bank operates as a commercial banking institution with total assets of $2,500.0 million
as of the examination date, representing +11.1% growth since the prior examination.
The Bank was chartered on March 15, 1985 and operates 7 branches in
San Francisco, CA and surrounding communities.

The examination scope included a comprehensive review of the Bank's financial condition, risk management practices, and compliance
with applicable laws and regulations. Examiners conducted detailed assessments of capital adequacy, asset quality, management capabilities,
earnings performance, liquidity position, and sensitivity to market risk. The examination team reviewed approximately 35.5%
of the Bank's loan portfolio, totaling $679.9 million, and conducted interviews with
16 members of the Board, senior management, and key personnel.

The examination reviewed the Bank's Liquidity Risk Management, Credit Risk Management, BSA/AML Compliance
 and identified 3 matters
requiring immediate attention.
These matters represent significant concerns regarding the Banks safety and soundness
and must be addressed in accordance with the timelines specified in this letter.

EXAMINATION SCOPE AND METHODOLOGY

The examination team consisted of 6 examiners and specialists who spent 44 days on-site and conducted
additional off-site analysis. The examination included the following key activities:

- Review of board and committee meeting minutes from the past 23 months
- Analysis of the Bank's strategic plan, budget, and financial projections
- Assessment of the loan portfolio through statistical sampling and targeted transaction testing
- Evaluation of the Bank's internal audit function and independent risk review processes
- Testing of information technology systems, cybersecurity controls, and business continuity planning
- Review of compliance management systems and consumer protection practices
- Assessment of vendor management and third-party risk management frameworks
- Evaluation of the Bank's capital planning processes and stress testing capabilities

The examination was led by Jennifer Jones, Examiner-in-Charge, with support from specialists in credit risk,
operational risk, compliance, and information technology. The examination findings and conclusions were discussed with the
Board of Directors and senior management during the exit meeting on January 30, 2026.


================================================================================
FINDING #1: Weaknesses in Contingency Funding Plan
================================================================================

Type: Matter Requiring Immediate Attention
Severity: High
Risk Area: Liquidity Risk Management

Description:
The Bank's liquidity risk management framework has material weaknesses.
Internal liquidity stress testing does not adequately capture the Bank's funding vulnerabilities,
particularly related to the concentration of uninsured deposits (22% of total deposits). The Bank's
contingency funding plan has not been updated since 2019 and does not reflect current balance sheet composition.

Our examination included a thorough review of the Bank's asset-liability management practices, funding strategies, and
liquidity risk monitoring systems. We identified significant concerns regarding the Bank's reliance on volatile funding sources,
including brokered deposits totaling $417.2M (21% of total deposits) and borrowings from the Federal
Home Loan Bank of $352.6M. The Bank's internal liquidity stress scenarios do not adequately consider the potential
for concurrent deposit outflows and reduced borrowing capacity during stressed conditions.

Additionally, the Bank's liquidity buffer consists primarily of investment securities with embedded interest rate risk,
and the contingent borrowing capacity has not been validated through test transactions in over 17 months. The funds
management committee meets only quarterly, which is insufficient given the current volatility in funding markets and the
Bank's aggressive growth strategy. Management information systems do not provide real-time visibility into deposit flows
or concentration metrics, limiting the Bank's ability to respond quickly to emerging liquidity pressures.

Impact:
These deficiencies present significant risk to the Bank's safety and soundness and require prompt corrective action.

Required Action:
The Board of Directors is required to immediately ensure that management develops and implements
a comprehensive remediation plan to address the deficiencies noted above. This plan must include specific
milestones, responsible parties, and completion dates. A written response must be submitted to the Federal
Reserve within 30 days of this letter.

Context:
- Composite Rating: 3
- Exam Loan Sample: 35.5% of portfolio reviewed
- Total Assets: $2,500.0 million; Business Model: Commercial Banking
- Expected Remediation Timeline: 45 days
- Citations: SR 10-6 (Liquidity Risk Management); 12 CFR 252 Subpart F

================================================================================
FINDING #2: Inadequate Loan Review Function
================================================================================

Type: Matter Requiring Attention
Severity: Moderate
Risk Area: Credit Risk Management

Description:
During the examination, we identified deficiencies in the Bank's credit risk management processes.
Specifically, the Bank's loan review function lacks independence and adequate staffing to effectively
identify emerging credit quality issues. Our sample review revealed 8 loans totaling $97.8M
that were inadequately risk-rated, with 16% requiring downgrade to classified status.

The examination team conducted a comprehensive review of the Bank's lending portfolio, including commercial real estate,
commercial and industrial, and consumer loans. We analyzed 68 loan relationships representing approximately
45% of the total loan portfolio. Our analysis revealed systematic weaknesses in the loan origination process,
particularly in the areas of financial statement analysis, collateral valuation, and covenant monitoring.

Furthermore, the Bank's credit policy lacks specific guidance on acceptable debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value limits,
and industry concentration thresholds. The credit administration function does not have adequate systems to track and report
credit exceptions, resulting in 43 instances where loans were approved outside of established credit parameters
without proper exception documentation or board approval. These weaknesses increase the Bank's exposure to credit losses and
diminish the Board's ability to provide effective oversight of credit risk.

Impact:
These deficiencies present elevated risk to the Bank and could adversely impact financial condition if left unaddressed.

Required Action:
The Board of Directors is required to ensure that management develops and implements an enhanced
credit risk management framework that addresses the deficiencies noted above. A detailed corrective
action plan should be submitted to the Federal Reserve within 90 days, with full
implementation expected within 90 days of this letter.

Context:
- Composite Rating: 3
- Exam Loan Sample: 35.5% of portfolio reviewed
- Total Assets: $2,500.0 million; Business Model: Commercial Banking
- Expected Remediation Timeline: 90 days
- Citations: SR 07-1 (Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in CRE); 12 CFR 365

================================================================================
FINDING #3: BSA/AML Compliance Deficiencies
================================================================================

Type: Matter Requiring Attention
Severity: Moderate
Risk Area: BSA/AML Compliance

Description:
The Bank's BSA/AML compliance program has material deficiencies. Customer due
diligence procedures are inadequate for 20% of higher-risk customer relationships reviewed. The suspicious
activity monitoring system generated 6 alerts that were inadequately investigated.

The examination included a comprehensive review of the Bank's BSA/AML compliance program, including customer due diligence,
suspicious activity monitoring, currency transaction reporting, and OFAC compliance. We identified systemic deficiencies in
the Bank's ability to identify, monitor, and report potentially suspicious activity. The Bank processed 4008 alerts
during the review period, but only filed 24 Suspicious Activity Reports, raising concerns about the adequacy of
alert disposition and investigation processes.

The Bank's customer risk rating methodology does not adequately consider all relevant risk factors, including geographic risk,
product/service risk, and customer behavior. We identified 44 high-risk customer relationships that lacked
enhanced due diligence documentation, including 6 politically exposed persons and 9 money service businesses.
Transaction monitoring scenarios have not been validated or tuned in over 48 months, and several scenarios
are generating excessive false positive alerts without proper management review or optimization.

Additionally, the BSA Officer position has experienced 3 turnovers in the past 3 years, and
current BSA staffing levels are inadequate given the Bank's risk profile and transaction volumes. Independent testing of the
BSA/AML program identified 19 issues in the prior examination cycle, and management has not fully addressed
these deficiencies. The Board receives limited information regarding BSA/AML compliance, and board members demonstrated
limited understanding of the Bank's BSA/AML risk exposure during examination interviews.

Impact:
These deficiencies present elevated risk to the Bank and could adversely impact financial condition if left unaddressed.

Required Action:
The Board of Directors is required to ensure that management develops and implements an enhanced
bsa/aml compliance framework that addresses the deficiencies noted above. A detailed corrective
action plan should be submitted to the Federal Reserve within 90 days, with full
implementation expected within 120 days of this letter.

Context:
- Composite Rating: 3
- Exam Loan Sample: 35.5% of portfolio reviewed
- Total Assets: $2,500.0 million; Business Model: Commercial Banking
- Expected Remediation Timeline: 120 days
- Citations: BSA (31 CFR Chapter X); FFIEC BSA/AML Manual

APPENDIX I: MATTERS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION (MRIAs)
================================================================================

MRIA #1: Weaknesses in Contingency Funding Plan

Issue: The Bank's liquidity risk management framework has material weaknesses.
Internal liquidity stress testing does not adequately capture the Bank's funding vulnerabilities,
particularly related to the concentration of uninsured deposits (22% of total deposits). The Bank's
contingency funding plan has not been updated since 2019 and does not reflect current balance sheet composition.

Our examination included a thorough review of the Bank's asset-liability management practices, funding strategies, and
liquidity risk monitoring systems. We identified significant concerns regarding the Bank's reliance on volatile funding sources,
including brokered deposits totaling $417.2M (21% of total deposits) and borrowings from the Federal
Home Loan Bank of $352.6M. The Bank's internal liquidity stress scenarios do not adequately consider the potential
for concurrent deposit outflows and reduced borrowing capacity during stressed conditions.

Additionally, the Bank's liquidity buffer consists primarily of investment securities with embedded interest rate risk,
and the contingent borrowing capacity has not been validated through test transactions in over 17 months. The funds
management committee meets only quarterly, which is insufficient given the current volatility in funding markets and the
Bank's aggressive growth strategy. Management information systems do not provide real-time visibility into deposit flows
or concentration metrics, limiting the Bank's ability to respond quickly to emerging liquidity pressures.
Required Action: Submit a remediation plan by April 15, 2026 that includes milestones, responsible parties, and board approval steps.


================================================================================

The Board of Directors should review this letter and provide a written response addressing the
findings noted above. Please contact Jennifer Jones, the examiner-in-charge,

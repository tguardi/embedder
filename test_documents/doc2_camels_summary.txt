EXAMINATION SCOPE

This was a full-scope safety and soundness examination of First National Bank of Commerce.

assessment of risk management practices across all major risk areas, evaluation of internal controls,
and review of compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

DETAILED COMPONENT ANALYSIS

CAPITAL (C) - Rating: 2

The Capital component assesses the level and quality of capital and the overall financial condition of the institution.
The Bank's Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 8.72% and Total Risk-Based Capital ratio of 11.95%
exceed well-capitalized standards.
Capital planning processes are adequate and stress testing
capabilities align with supervisory expectations for an institution
of this size and complexity.

The Bank's capital position is adequate
relative to the Bank's risk profile. The Bank maintains diverse capital raising
capabilities through multiple channels including retained earnings
, equity issuance, and subordinated debt. The capital planning process
incorporates comprehensive stress testing that
adequately considers the Bank's key risks and vulnerabilities.

ASSET QUALITY (A) - Rating: 3

The Asset Quality component reflects the quantity of existing and potential credit risk associated with the loan and investment
portfolios. The Bank's nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of 1.96% is acceptable
compared to peer institutions of similar size and business model.

Credit risk management practices are adequate
with acceptable underwriting
standards, loan review processes, and portfolio monitoring systems. The loan portfolio composition reflects
elevated concentration risk in commercial banking lending.
Management should enhance effective problem loan identification and
workout processes.

The Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (ALLL) methodology is adequate but requires improvement,
incorporating limited quantitative and qualitative risk factors.
The current ALLL level of $30.00 million (1.01% of loans) is
marginally adequate
to absorb expected credit losses based on current portfolio risk characteristics.

MANAGEMENT (M) - Rating: 3

The Management component reflects the capability of the board of directors and management to identify, measure, monitor, and
control the risks of the institution's activities. Board and management oversight is satisfactory,
with adequate strategic
planning, risk management frameworks, and internal controls.

The Board of Directors demonstrates adequate
understanding of the Bank's risk profile and provides satisfactory
oversight through adequately structured
board committees. Senior management possesses sufficient
industry expertise and generally demonstrates
sound judgment in managing the Bank's operations.

Risk management information systems provide adequate
data to support decision-making. Internal audit and compliance functions are generally adequate but require enhancement.

EARNINGS (E) - Rating: 2

The Earnings component measures current period earnings performance, sustainability of earnings, and the adequacy of provisions
and reserves. The Bank's ROA of 1.18% and ROE of 13.36% are strong
relative to peers and demonstrate solid
earnings capacity to support operations and capital growth.

The Net Interest Margin of 4.27% reflects effective
spread management in the current interest rate environment. Noninterest income sources are diverse,
with multiple fee-generating business lines. The efficiency ratio of 56.27%
indicates strong expense control
relative to revenue generation.

Earnings consistently exceed
the Bank's internal performance targets and strategic objectives. Provision expense is appropriate
relative to asset quality trends and portfolio growth. Earnings sustainability is strong
considering competitive pressures, interest rate risks, and the Bank's strategic direction.

LIQUIDITY (L) - Rating: 3

The Liquidity component reflects the adequacy of the institution's current and prospective sources and uses of funds.
The Bank's loan-to-deposit ratio of 86.14% is moderate
relative to peers and provides adequate
liquidity capacity for balance sheet growth or funding stress.

Liquidity risk management processes are satisfactory,
with adequate stress testing,
contingency funding planning, and liquidity buffer management. The Bank maintains adequate
funding sources through core deposits, wholesale funding, and available borrowing lines.

The liquidity position is satisfactory,
with adequate unencumbered
liquid assets available to meet cash flow needs. Deposit composition reflects moderate
reliance on rate-sensitive and uninsured deposits, which moderately increases
funding volatility risk.

SENSITIVITY TO MARKET RISK (S) - Rating: 2

The Sensitivity component reflects the degree to which changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, or
equity prices can adversely affect earnings or capital. Interest rate risk is well-managed,
with comprehensive measurement
systems and effective
hedging strategies to mitigate exposure.

Asset-liability management processes effectively identify and control
interest rate risk arising from mismatches in repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities. The Bank's interest rate risk
position is conservative,
with earnings and capital well-protected
to adverse interest rate movements.

MATTERS REQUIRING ATTENTION

The examination identified 3 supervisory matters
requiring attention, including 1 matter
requiring immediate attention (MRIA) and 2 matters
requiring attention (MRA).

Detailed findings and required corrective actions are provided in the separate supervisory letter dated
March 01, 2026. The Bank must develop and implement comprehensive remediation plans to address
all identified matters within the specified timeframes. The Federal Reserve will conduct follow-up examinations to assess
progress in addressing these supervisory concerns.

CONCLUSION

This CAMELS rating reflects the Bank's financial condition, risk management practices, and compliance with applicable laws and
regulations as of January 30, 2026. The Bank should continue to enhance
its financial condition and risk management frameworks to ensure safe and sound operations. The Board and management should
address all supervisory matters in a timely and effective manner and should contact the Federal Reserve with any questions
regarding supervisory expectations or examination findings.
